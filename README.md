# SIEMAzureSentinel

The purpose of the lab is to great a Azure cloud environment using the build in Sentinal lab. Once setup we will have an exposed VM that logs traffic what an potentian attacker does aka SIEM. The guide will be covered from a complete beginner level of Azure cloud.

First create a virtual machine (Search virtual machines and click on the service), which purpose is to be exposed, or a honey pot, then click create -> Virtual machine.

Make sure the subscription is selected on "Pay-as-you-go", as it will only use up the payment of the free resources provided when the account was created

Create a new resource group, we will be using all the lab resources in this group. We will call it "Honeypotlab"
